## Simple Web Stack Infrastructure

This project demonstrates a simple web stack infrastructure consisting of a single server hosting all
necessary components to serve a website. The infrastructure includes a web server, application server,
database, and the application code, all running on one machine.

## Distributed Web Infrastructure

This project presents a three-server distributed web infrastructure design for hosting `www.foobar.com`.
The architecture focuses on high availability, load distribution, and fault tolerance through redundancy
and proper component separation.

## Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

A three-server web infrastructure design for hosting `www.foobar.com` with comprehensive security, SSL encryption, and monitoring capabilities. This infrastructure implements a multi-layered security approach with load balancing and comprehensive monitoring for a production web application.

## Scale Up Web Infrastructure

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **scaled web infrastructure** with high availability, load balancing, and proper component separation following enterprise-grade architecture principles.

Read more about the [Scale Up Web Infrastructure](./3-scale_up).
